    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Drafting notes for free end user licence agreement
This EULA (end user licence agreement) template can be used to create shrink-wrap, click-wrap and web-wrap licences between a licensor and its customers. The customers may be businesses and/or consumers (although the template does not include provisions relating to EU distance selling laws).
Optional provisions containing a right to return software are included. These are particularly relevant in the case of shrink-wrap and click-wrap licences. Of course, in addition to considering the inclusion of a right to return software, vendors should where practicable apply technological protection measures to software, so that it is not possible for a buyer to install the software without accepting a click-wrap version of the EULA.
In addition, optional provisions concerning software updates and support services are included.
The EULA is intended to form a contract between the licensor and licensee. The courts in some jurisdictions have found some EULAs to be unenforceable.
Preamble to end user licence agreement
Should the User return the software if the terms of this document are not accepted? Within what period must the software be returned? Will there be a right to return the software for a refund?
This wording may be used for "shrink-wrap" software agreements - that is, agreements that are visible through product packaging and are formally accepted when a person unseals the software packaging. There may be a right to return software, because a customer may not have a chance to review the agreement terms before purchasing the software.
Will customers have a right to return the software if they do not accept this document? How should the software be returned? Will the customer be entitled to a refund upon the return of the software under this provision?
This wording may be used for "click-wrap" software agreements - that is, agreements that are formally accepted as part of the software installation process. There is an optional right to return the software, which should be included where customers will or may not have a chance to review the agreement terms before purchasing the software.
This wording may be used for "web-wrap" agreements - that is, agreements that are formally accepted on a website before the software is downloaded. Accordingly, there is no right to return the software.
Optional element.
What third parties may use the software on behalf of, or under the authorisation of, the licensee? Identify relevant persons.

The law in this area is complex and uncertain, and you should consider taking legal advice if resale may be an issue for you.

Clause 14 - Limitations and exclusions of liability
Contractual limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated and controlled by law, and the courts may rule that particular limitations and exclusions of liability in contracts are unenforceable. The courts are particularly likely to intervene where a party is seeking to rely on a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard terms and conditions, but will also sometimes intervene where a term has been individually negotiated. The courts may be more likely to rule that provisions excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting liability, are unenforceable.
If there is a risk that any particular limitation or exclusion of liability will be found to be unenforceable by the courts, that provision should be drafted as an independent term, and be numbered separately from the other provisions. It may improve the chances of a limitation or exclusion of liability being found to be enforceable if the party seeking to rely upon it specifically drew it to the attention of the other party before the contract was entered into.
Exclusions and limitations of liability in UK contracts are primarily regulated by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 ("UCTA") and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 ("UTCCRs").
Contracts regulated by UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 2(1), UCTA). Except insofar as the relevant term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such contracts cannot exclude or restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of an express or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for misrepresentation (Section 3, Misrepresentation Act 1967).
In addition, if a contract is regulated by UCTA, and one of the parties is dealing as a consumer or on the other's written standard terms of business, then except insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict his liability in respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him; or (iii) claim to be entitled, in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no contractual performance at all (see Section 3, UCTA). UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly in the case of contracts for the sale of goods and contracts under which possession or ownership of goods passes.
The UTCCRs overlap with UCTA. They provide that "A contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer" (Regulation 5(1)). Such contract terms are not binding upon a consumer. A list of the types of terms which may be considered unfair under the UTCCRs is set out in Schedule 2. A few of these have implications for the drafting of limitations and exclusions of liability. For example, one class of contract terms which may be unfair are terms "which have the object or effect of ... inappropriately excluding or limiting the legal rights of the consumer vis-à-vis the seller or supplier or another party in the event of total or partial non-performance or inadequate performance by the seller or supplier of any of the contractual obligations".
If you wish to try to limit or exclude liability in respect of reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory breaches of contract, you should specify this in relation to the relevant provision (for example, using the following wording: "The limitations and exclusions of liability in this Clause [number] will apply whether or not the liability in question arises out of any reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory conduct or breach of contract"). In many circumstances, however, the courts will find these types of limitations and exclusions to be unenforceable.
These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of liability.
Clause 14.1
Do not delete this provision (except upon legal advice). Without this provision, the specific limitations and exclusions of liability in the document are more likely to be unenforceable.
Clause 14.4
Optional element.
Clause 14.5
Optional element.
Clause 14.6
Optional element.
Clause 14.7
Optional element.
Clause 14.8
Optional element.
"Consequential loss" has a special meaning in English law: it means any loss that, whilst not arising naturally from the breach, was specifically in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.
Clause 14.9
Do you want to include a per event liability cap in this document?
(a) - What monetary amount should be used in the liability cap?
(b) - What floating amount should be used in the liability cap? The charge payable during what period, prior to the event or events, should be used for calculating this liability cap?
Liability caps may be unenforceable in practice.
Clause 14.10
Do you want to include an aggregate liability cap in this document?
(a) - What monetary amount should be used in the liability cap?
(b) - What floating amount should be used in the liability cap?
Liability caps may be unenforceable in practice.
Clause 15 - Termination
Clause 15.1
Optional element.
What notice period will apply? Must the notice of termination expire after some particular period, or on some particular day? How will the limitation on the expiry of the termination notice period operate? Specify the relevant period.
Clause 15.2
What notice period will apply? Must the notice of termination expire after some particular period, or on some particular day? How will the limitation on the expiry of the termination notice period operate? Specify the relevant period.
Clause 15.3
(a) - Will all breaches, or only material breaches, give rise to a right of termination? If the breach is remediable, should the party in breach be given an opportunity to remedy the breach before the right of termination becomes available to the other party?
(ii) - What remediation period will apply here?
(b) - Should each party have a right to terminate if the other party is persistently in breach of contract, even where there has been no material breach?
Clause 15.4
(c) - Will the winding up of a party as part of a solvent company reorganisation give rise to a right of termination for the other party?
(d) - Will or might a party to the document be an individual, rather than a corporate entity?
Clause 15.5
Optional element.
(b) - What notice period applies in the case of termination for non-payment?
Clause 16 - Effects of termination
Clause 16.3
Optional element.
Within what period following termination must charges in respect of services be settled?
(a) - Specify those charges that the User must pay to the Licensor upon termination.
(b) - Specify those charges that the Licensor must refund to the User upon termination.
This provision will not be suitable in all circumstances. The appropriate treatment of charges upon termination will vary from contract to contract.
Clause 16.4
Optional element.
Clause 16.5
Optional element.
Within what period following termination must licensed software copies be returned, destroyed or deleted?
Clause 17 - General
Clause 17.3
This is intended to prevent, for example, one party wrongfully claiming that a term of the contract was changed in a telephone call.
Clause 17.5
This provision is designed to exclude any rights a third party may have under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
Clause 17.8
Which law will govern the document?
This template has been drafted to work in the English law context. If you plan to change the governing law, you should have the document reviewed by someone with expertise in the law of the relevant jurisdiction.
Clause 17.9
The courts of which jurisdiction will have the exclusive right to adjudicate disputes relating to the document (subject to applicable law)?
As a practical matter, it makes sense for the courts with expertise in the relevant law to have the right to adjudicate disputes. Where one of the parties is outside England (or at least the UK), you may want to grant the courts of their home jurisdiction the right to adjudicate disputes, as this could ease enforcement in some circumstances.
Clause 18 - Interpretation
Should provisions concerning the interpretation of the document be included?
Clause 18.3
This provision is designed to exclude the application of a rule of interpretation known as the ejusdem generis rule. That rule may affect the interpretation of contractual clauses that list particular examples or instances of some more general idea, by limiting the scope of the general idea by reference to those particular examples or instances.
