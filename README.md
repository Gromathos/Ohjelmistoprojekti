# Ohjelmistoprojekti

Ohjelmistoprojekti was a school project that I've decided to upload to GitHub.
The project was created using c# programming language with Visual Studio 2015. It also uses MySQL database to get its data.

## Getting Ohjelmistoprojekti running

1. Download xampp and install it(https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Get Visual Studio (https://www.visualstudio.com/)
3. Get the code and run it.
